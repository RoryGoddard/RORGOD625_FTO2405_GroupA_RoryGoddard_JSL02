# [JSL02] Submission: Debug the DOM

## Project Overview 
Implement functionality that would prevent duplicate goals being added into the Workout Tracker App. 
This challenge was a good exercise in a number of elements, particuarly the DOM, working with nodes and node lists, as well as the differences between methods such as getelementbyid and queryselector. 
I enjoyed the project and I feel more confident with my abilities to manipulate the DOM having done this. I noticed that it was possible to have negative glasses of water and so I took it upon myself to fix that and implemented a straight forward if statement to prevent things like people have -5 glasses of water drunk. The main challenge for the project, once broken down into components such as defining the necessary variables, adding the remove logic, adding the new goal logic, and checking for equality between the text content of the items within the node list against the input element text, was a good test of our abilities to affect and manipulate the DOM.

## Final Thoughts
This was a fun challenge and I am looking forward to JSL03. So far these have been fun bite sized puzzles to work out and it's been a great way to practice the topics we have covered in this section of the module.
